**Learning:** Users struggling to decode complex visualizations (10+ color codes) benefit significantly from an always-visible legend. Relying on memory or clicking individual items is a high friction point.
**Action:** When visualizing categorized data, always include an inline key or legend. Don't assume users know what "purple" means in your specific context. Added hover tooltips to further reduce the need for clicks.
